FileTransfer
You can use this app to share files between two pcs on a local network or if you are lucky enough (not behind several ISP routers) you can even share files with friends over the internet. For this to work you'll have to set up your router to use port forwarding.The app works on port 55555.If you want to use a custom port, feel free to update the code at your leisure. Note that exposing your private IP to the public is a dangerous practice but if you have pc just for fun, you can add it to the DMZ router zone and rock!
